Welcome to my encyclopedia! I've created this encyclopedia to keep track of things that I want to note down; I don't keep with myself a notebook. I created this while I'm at the [University of Washington](uw), so you would expect an amount of articles relating to people or places around Seattle.

The encyclopedia is personal and opinionated (unlike Wikipedia) because it is not written in academic style or neutral voice. It would be impossible for me to enjoy writing an article about a local caf√© without interjecting some personal experiences with it. You might or might not find information here useful. If it hasn't been obvious, you should not use the content on this web page for your academic papers.

Enjoy!
