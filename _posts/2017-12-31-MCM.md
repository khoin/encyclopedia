**McMahon Hall** (MCM) was a residential hall at the north side of the [University of Washington](uw), Seattle. I can't find online on who it's named after so, I'll do that once I'm back on campus.

I'm living here.

McMahon also houses The 8, which is a dining area below ground level. It consists of several restaurants serving different food. There's also convenient store, the Nook, which opens until 2AM everyday (there are exceptions); really useful.

There's a music practice room on the North wing of McMahon. The room has an upright piano and no ventilation. McMahon also have a mini gym, which I never used but should.

The housing charges were:

* 3083.00	$ (AUT 2017, DOUBLE) SEP 20 2016
* 3083.00	$ (WIT 2018, DOUBLE) DEC 27 2016
* 3083.00	$ (WIT 2018, DOUBLE) EXPECTED

Total: 9249.0 per academic year

Nothing. Apparently, McMahon is boring, you can't find anything interesting about it online.
