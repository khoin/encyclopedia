**Nikolai Kapustin** (b. 1937 November 22) is a composer and pianist. The best way to describe his music would be the fusion of classical and jazz. The term would be [Third Stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_stream), better described by Wikipedia.

I found about Kapustin through [Nathan Lee](nathan_lee) who [played at the UW](https://music.washington.edu/events/2017-10-08/catch-rising-star-nathan-lee-piano). Nathan Lee played Kapustin's Op 41 Variations which became one of my favorite piano solo pieces.

It is amazing to see a great composer still alive at our time. To see a great composer playing his own piece on our time is such a rarity. It is quite a pity his music is largely unknown (in the West) until the 21st century, due to the Iron Curtain. I wonder how much great music is burried during that time.
