**Isao Tomita** (1932 April 22 - 2016 May 5) is a musician. He is a pioneer in electronic music and the arrangments of classical music for electronic [synthesizers](synthesizers).

I did not know about Tomita until his death in 2016. I looked up his music when I heard the news. As a result, I found not only his great synthesizers arrangements, but also [Debussy](debussy)'s music, which is already full of imagery on piano.

If you've heard about [Wendy Carlos](carlos) who've done Bach's works on synthesizers, then you might like Tomita.
