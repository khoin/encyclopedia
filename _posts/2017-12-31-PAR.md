**Parrington (PAR)** is a Hall at the University of Washington. It is named after English professor, Louis Vernon Parrington, one of the first faculty member at the university. The hall is also the second oldest building on campus!

Here, I worked for Evans School of Public Policy and Governance as tech support. The printer monitoring interface I made while I was there is [still online](https://depts.washington.edu/pbafhelp/)!

There are [plans](http://archive.is/lPz5O) to remodel the building. There are three stairways in the building. Two at each end and one in the middle. Only the middle one is accessible from the ground floor. The stairs at the back and front is only accessible if you go upstairs.

Since I walked to work everyday from [Haggett](HGT), at times, I'd see cool things like [gulls eating from a can](https://students.washington.edu/koi/img/parrington-gull.jpg). In fact, I liked that picture so much I commissioned False Knees to illustrate it:
