**Haggett Hall** (HGT) is a residential hall at the north side of [University of Washington](uw), Seattle. It is named after Arthur and Winnifred Haggett. The rooms were hexagonals. There's a walk-in closet which took triangular shape. The original building is to be demolished in 2018 and replaced with newer dorms [1](#footnotes). It's built in the 1960s, and this entry refers to the hall built then.

I lived in South 361 Haggett Hall during my freshman year at the University. There was no dining area in this hall, so we'd have to walk over to [McMahon Hall](MCM) to get food. Although the hall consisted of two towers, it is connected by a lobby on the ground floor along with a pathway the floor below. This was especially useful if there's no available laundry machines on your side of the tower.

Haggett Hall was also home to Rick's Caf√©, where you could get 3 scoops of ice cream for $1, and was run by student volunteers. There was also a Yamaha Grand Piano in the Grey Lounge up until June 2017 where it [was sold](https://twitter.com/UWSurplus/status/873348518689161216) and replaced by a newer KAWAI upright piano. 

Each tower of Haggett has 8 floors. Every two floors share one common lounge, and can access each other either through the emergency stairs at both ends of the wings or the stairs in the lounge. There are 2 bathrooms on each floor, and the gender of the bathrooms alternatives between the wings and the floor of a tower. There are 3 showers in each bathroom, and surprisingly I've never had trouble with all 3 being used.

The housing charges were:

* 3420.00	$ (AUT 2016, DOUBLE) SEP 21 2016
* 3276.00	$ (WIT 2017, DOUBLE) DEC 28 2016
* 3026.00	$ (SPR 2017, DOUBLE) MAR 22 2017

Total: 9722.00 per academic year

This is strange, because I have a consistent charge for my residency at McMahon the following year.
