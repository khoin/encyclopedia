Events seem to happen more often when you pay attention to them, and it appears to me that 2024 ends with more events than a typical year. Is it because within 3 months I will have spent a decade in the U.S., or is it because of the recency bias?

I could reflect on the recent assassination attempt of the President-Elect back in July; the 37-year low of the Japanese Yen to USD in June; the pathetic Democratic loss in the November 2024 Election; or the recent CEO killer this month. But I ought to maintain my growing apathy towards sensationalized politics over the last 2 years, and start my 2024 review with the most boring object in one's life: my personal finance.

### Personal Finance

#### Student Loan

My 2024 started off with my student loans completely paid off. Its highest balance was around 14,500 USD, around August 2023. The decision to keep the loan until Jan 2024 was probably due to Biden's administration (failed) attempt to cancel the loan. 2023 was still in the "forbearance" period which allowed me to get a refund of the loans to put in high yield saving accounts. The gains were probably not much, but at the time it probably served as a very good emergency fund - one which I should've kept, since their rates are still at 4.5%, while my loans were either 2.x% to 3-4%. 

Paying off the college debt early also meant my accounts are closed earlier. This opportunity to improve my credit score was sadly missed. My fear of debt should get a serious self-psychological assessment.

#### Quick Stats

Looking at my YNAB's Reflect page:

* I've saved roughly $3100 this year -- a pathetic amount. I am expecting another paycheck this month, but that only adds around $1k.
* If I remove my Roth IRA from the equation, I've saved only $1700 this year. That is less than $200 a month.

What do I include in the calculation? I removed my car loan and Roland RD-2000 from the calculation, since I'm unable to valuate them. Including them means my loan payment each month has a $0 effect. Now, if I include them both, I will get a number that is "how much do I have left if I had to pay all my debt right now?" which is $7400. So, I am fine there.

#### Worst Offenders

Why did I save so little? Here are some offenders:

#### Trips

* $ 475.01: March Trip to Boston (for Anime Boston).  Plane tickets were bought in 2023.
* $ 221.16: April weekend trip to PDX. The cheapest trip for this year.
* $1717.77: July Trip to LAX (for Anime Expo), including associated expenses. 
* $ 815.++: November Trip to PDX (for Kumoricon). I'm not quite sure how this trip is more expensive than the Boston trip. Probably the hotel.

#### Education

* $2100.00: Tuition for 1 Quarter of an online audio productions class at UW. (not worth the price)

#### Car


* $ 765.22 avg PER MONTH: On my car. Payments, tabs, Oil change, fluids, services, etc. Also includes Lyfts, transit.

#### Eating out

* $ 487.51 avg PER MONTH, on eating out combined. (Eating out includes outside coffee/drinks (incl. those bought at groceries store that does not happen on a grocery run), or fast-food for lunch or breakfast.). This is 10% of my monthly pre-taxed income, which is ridiculous.

#### Goals for 2025.

Planning a trip for Japan. I plan to cut down on eating out to $200 a month. So, $50 per week for eating out, including random snacks and fine dining.
